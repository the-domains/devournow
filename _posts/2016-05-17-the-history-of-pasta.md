The History of Pasta

Presently, the world recognizes pasta as the flavour of the Italians. It has become the same with Italian food across the world. The preparation and storage have been very easy, which makes it the symbol of Italian food all across the globe. Tomato sauce and pizza have been popular Italian foods that have been enjoyed by people in different countries. However, the history of pasta has been known to date back to a much older time than pizza or tomato sauce or for that matter, any other common Italian food.

Legend says that Marco Polo first introduced pasta to the Italian public. Marco Polo, in turn has been believed to pick it up on his various travels across the world. Nonetheless, history reveals that pasta had already been popularized around his time. The history of Pasta dates back to a time long before Marco Polo. Actually, it has been believed to become a popular Italian dish right from the eighth century onwards. It was around this time that Arab's invasion had greatly influenced the food in Italy. It has been believed that the pasta was born because of the combination of Italian and Arabic foods.

This does not necessarily mean that the Italians were not major players in the evolution of Pasta, as it has been commonly believed. Around 400 B.C. the Etruscans, who used to live in regions surrounding the western part of Italy, created a noodle very similar to Lasagna. This noodle was believed to be made from spelt, which is a grain from which the wheat has evolved.

It was much later, when the Romans were given credit with making noodles similar to the one made by the Etruscans, which was made from water and flour. However, these noodles were, similar to the versions of the Chinese, prepared by baking in the oven. Pasta has come a long way to remain the favourite food of the people.
