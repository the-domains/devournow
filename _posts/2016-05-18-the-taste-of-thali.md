The Taste of Thali

One of the most distinctive features of Indian and Nepalese dining are those fun and interesting stainless steel plates and bowls, each piece of the meal separated from the rest. This style of eating is called Thali. There are six small bowls and a larger one, all placed on a high-sided serving tray. In many restaurants and home, these dishes are made from copper. 

The purpose of a Thali dish is to offer diners the six major tastes all at once without mixing them together: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy. This is typically served with rice in the centre to pull it all together. 

Traditionally, all of the food is eaten with the hands, creating an even greater dining experience than European dining. Seeing, smelling and tasting are the norms for European dining, but with Thali dining, there is also touch. The tactile experience of the food is one of the most wonderful pleasures of Indian cuisine.

The ability to mix tastes at will makes Thali dining fun and interesting. One is able to discover unique combinations of flavours that stand out and create a unique meal for each individual diner.

As traditional dining goes, Thali dining is among the most faithful to the original and is still one of the most wonderful ways to eat. Diana Downtown in downtown Guelph features a Traditional Thali worth checking out on your next trip to Wellington County.
