Anyone who enjoys history will love going to downtown Guelph, Ontario. Guelph is known for its historical, limestone architecture and is made up of a series of public squares. It is very easy to get into downtown Guelph and everyone will find multiple types of retail, dining and entertainment services here.

Market Square is modeled after the original Market Place District from the 1800's. The original Market Place was a common shopping and meeting place. The current Market Square is a beautiful place to meet with friends, go shopping or enjoy one of the many concerts or events that are held there. The main feature of this square is the water fountain that is surrounded by stone benches. At nighttime, lights go on, so that everyone can continue enjoying the magnificent area

Every Saturday for over 180 years, people have been able to enjoy the Guelph Farmer's Market. It is a community event that is family friendly and everyone seems to know everyone here. During the winter months, the stands are found inside the market building, but in warmer months, many people will set up outside.There are quite a few historical sites in Guelph. One of the historical sites is Old City Hall, which was built in 1856 and was originally used as the city government building. Not far from the city centre is one of the two covered bridges that are located in Ontario. A day or evening out can be done with visits to the Guelph Museums or a performance at the River Run Centre. Sports enthusiasts will enjoy a Guelph Storm hockey game or other sporting events at the Sleeman Centre.
