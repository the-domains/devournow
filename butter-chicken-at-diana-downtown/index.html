One of the historical sites is Old City Hall, which was built in 1856 and was originally used as the city government building. Not far from the city centre is one of the two covered bridges that are located in Ontario. A day or evening out can be done with visits to the Guelph Museums or a performance at the River Run Centre. Sports enthusiasts will enjoy a Guelph Storm hockey game or other sporting events at the Sleeman Centre.</p><p><a href="http://www.dianadowntown.com/">Diana Downtown</a> has been part of downtown Guelph for over 25 years.
