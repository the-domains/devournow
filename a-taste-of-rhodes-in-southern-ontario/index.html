After all, Rhodes was the inspiration behind this restaurant. Rhodes, Greece is the capital of the Dodecanese Islands and is one of the more popular destinations in all of Europe. It is also home to Colossus of Rhodes, which is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. When you are vacationing in Rhodes, you get to experience green hills and valleys as well as miles of beaches. </p><p>The Palace of the Grand Master is located in the Old Town and was built at the end of the 7th century. It was originally a Byzantine fortress and was turned into a residence for the Grand Master during the 14th century. After an explosion destroyed the building in 1856, it was rebuilt from the original drawings in 1940. It now serves as the Byzantine Museum and holds exhibits and cultural events. </p><p>​​While you are visiting The Palace of the Grand Master, you should continue touring the rest of Old Town. During your tour, you will see towers, Gothic windows, paved courtyards, old lamps, narrow streets and old churches. The Street of the Knights is a street lined with inns and you will find the Mosque of Suleiman and the Clock Tower off of Socrates Street. </p><p>Aristotle’s Street comes out of Hippocrates Square and takes you to the old Jewish quarter and the Square of the Hebrew Martyrs. There is a fountain located here and the square is named for the thousands of Jews that were gathered here before being sent to Auschwitz in 1943. Many of those Jews never returned home. A visit to the Turkish Library, which was founded in 1794, and holds important Turkish manuscripts will complete your tour of Old Town. </p><picture>

<p>Before you head outside the Old Town walls, grab a bite to eat at <a href="http://www.hatzikelisseafoodrestaurant.com/#!restaurant/crrl">Hatzikelis Seafood Restaurant.</a></p><p>They have been serving Greek and Mediterranean food since 1982. Whether you are seated inside or out in the courtyard, overlooking the ruined Church of the Virgin, you are guaranteed to enjoy all of their entrees. They use the freshest foods and take the time to prepare every dish with love. As you head into the “New City”, you will be able to walk through Mandraki. Mandraki is a marina that has windmills and Rhodian deer statues. Rodini Park is another area of beauty and is also one of the oldest parks in the world. There are bridges that go over ponds and streams. You will be able to see some rare plants and walk along with a peacock or two. </p><p>It is easy to see why Rhodes, Greece is a popular vacation destination. The people who live there embrace their culture and their past and they are willing to share all of this with others. People who are visiting for the first time will be amazed at how well the city is cared for and by the end of their time there, they will feel like they have a new home. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">A Taste of Rhodes in Southern Ontario</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
