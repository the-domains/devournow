People are drawn to the area, because of the hiking and other available activities out in nature. The city also has numerous festivals throughout the year.</p><p>The Spencer Smith Park is located in downtown Burlington along the shore of Lake Ontario. During the winter months, the Centennial Pond features ice skating and it turns into a model sailboat pond during the summertime. Children can play in the water play area at the Dofasco Waterjet plaza and at the playground. There are plenty of walking paths throughout the park, so everyone can enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p><p>A few of the festivals in the city are at Spencer Smith Park and include the Sound of Music Festival, Canada’s Largest Ribfest, Canada Day, Children’s Festival, Lakeside Festival of Lights and the Burlington Beer Festival.</p><p>The Ireland House and Museum is an active part of Burlington’s past. The house was built between 1835 and 1837 and was the home of one of Burlington’s earliest settlers, Joseph Ireland. His descendants lived at the home until 1985 and the city purchased the property in 1987 from the estate of Lucie Marie Ireland Bush. They established the museum and restored the buildings, so that they show the three time periods of when each of the generations stayed on the property. Tours of the property along with historical demonstrations are offered to visitors.</p><p>The Art Gallery of Burlington is a great place to spend the afternoon. Visitors are able to explore different exhibits that focus on contemporary Canadian ceramic art, visual artists in the region and multiple resident art and craft guilds. The Art Gallery has accumulated over 2,300 pieces of contemporary Canadian ceramics over the past thirty years. Their collection represents pieces from all areas of the country, but they also have an expansive collection of certain outstanding artists, so that they can represent the artist’s entire career.</p><p>After a full day of exploring Burlington, everyone needs to stop in to <a href="http://artisanpizza.ca/">Artisan Pizza</a>. They create their pizzas with the freshest ingredients and they make their own dough daily. They offer a large selection of choices on their menu and it would be impossible to not be able to find a specific type of pizza. They even have a solution for people who have gluten or lactose intolerance and people who are vegans. They make gluten free pizza crust and they also have 100% lactose and casein free Daiya cheese and soy cheese.</p><p>It is the perfect place to relax, enjoy a delicious meal and talk about everything you did that day in Burlington.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e18cc71d-8f5b-43d1-866f-0aab5bd02294.jpg" title="Artisan Pizza" alt="Hawaiian Style at Artisan in Burlington"></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Discover Burlington; Eat.
